The objectives of optimization is to increase profit, quality and improve time. As resources, time and money are always limited in real-world applications. 
Mathematical optimization or programming is the study of such planning and design problems using mathematical tools. 
Computer simulations have become an indispensable tool for solving such optimization problems [with various efficient search algorithms.

OPTIMIZATION
Mathematical speaking, it is possible to write most optimization problems in the generic form. 
Classification of optimization problems according to the number of objectives: 
Single objective M = 1
Multiobjective M > 1, it is also referred to as multicriteria or even multi-attributes optimization in the literature.
