SEARCH FOR OPTIMALITY 
After an optimization problem is formulated correctly.
The main task is to find the optimal solutions by solution procedure using the right mathematical techniques.
Random walk is a main characteristic of modern search algorithms. 
Swarm intelligence and corresponding to particle swarm optimization.
Genetic algorithms or evolutionary algorithms where the search agents are improving. 
They try to use the best solutions or agents, and randomise or replace the not-so-good ones, while evaluating each individualâ€™s competence (fitness) in combination with the system history (use of memory).  With such a balance, we intend to design better and efficient optimization algorithms.
